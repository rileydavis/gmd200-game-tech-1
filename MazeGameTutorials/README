h1. MazeGameTutorials, source code and projects

The goal of this tutorial sequence is to provide the key elements that will enable you to create a Maze Game.

h2. Authors

The Maze Game Tutorial was originally created by Joe Manley manley@champlain.edu. Revisions, new wiki tutorials, revised source code and Unity projects were created by Jonathan Ferguson jferguson@champlain.edu in Spring 2019.

h2. Building the tutorials

This source code distribution relies on the wiki tutorials for instructions on the function and purpose of the tutorial. Start by following the tutorials.

As these are Unity 3D projects (2D Gameplay and projects), having a copy of Unity 3D is required to make sense of the projects. Note that Unity 3D is a proprietary software distribution. It is *not* freedom preserving software, but it is free-to-use. One can obtain Unity 3D from: @https://unity.com/@

Specific Unity 3D version information for each project can be found in the @ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt@ file. Matching versions of Unity 3D can be downloaded using the Unity Hub:
@https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html@

These tutorials are not expected to be atcually built into a working executable, as these are exercises for in-editor, and are expected to be submitted for evaluation in source-code form.

h2. Licensing: GPLv3 (code), CC-BY-SA (assets)
 
The MazeGameTutorials project code and related project files are licensed under the GNU Public License 3.0 (GPLv3). Wiki tutorial materials, sprites, audio and other assets are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA) and then imported into the GPLv3 for the purposes of source code distribution.

Note that Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International is ONE WAY compatible with the GPL 3.0, meaning that one may import changes from works licensed under CC-BY-SA, and license the resulting combined work as GPLv3. See: https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3 

The practical upshot is that you should expect to comply with the GPLv3 when distributing, making changes to, or other applicable uses of this project. The most substantial difference is that you are expected to therefore include the source-code to support future changes.  In other words: for assets, keep the publically-documented, original editor files available in the source-code distribution of this project. 

There are two reasons for split-licensing:

* In some cases, asset sources may not be available, but are used in these tutorials.
* To allow other uses of the Wiki tutorials, art and other assets, independent of the terms of the GPLv3, even though the GPLv3 preserves more of your computing freedoms than CC-BY-SA.

Full-text of these licenses is available in files titled: COPYING and pertain to the directory tree below which the COPYING file appears. Individual source code files contain a copyright license notice for the GPLv3.
